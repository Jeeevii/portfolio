          Hello, I'm a Computer Science student at UC Santa Cruz, graduating in June 2025. I'm very passionate about building full-stack applications from the ground up, with a particular focus on backend development. 
          I enjoy working with server interactions, APIs, and databases to create scalable and efficient systems, and I love the challenge of turning complex problems into well-structured solutions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-zinc-400">
          I'm actively seeking entry-level software engineering roles or internships to continue expanding my skills and grow as a developer. 
          I thrive in environments where I can learn, collaborate, and make meaningful contributions while building real-world applications. 
          Whether it's crafting the perfect backend or getting the frontend just right, I enjoy creating seamless, user-centered experiences.
        </p>
        <p className="text-zinc-400">
          Outside of coding, I'm an avid basketball player, gym-goer, and fisherman. I also love playing games with friends and, of course, solving LeetCode problems (because who doesnâ€™t enjoy a good brain workout??). 
          I'm always up for new challenges, whether it's on the court, in the code, or in life.
        </p>
